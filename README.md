Introduction

Before:
This is the first homework in The Odin Project that will actually get my hands dirty. I need to deconstruct the Google homepage and learn about how it's coded in terms of HTML and CSS.

After:
I was able to put up the main sections of the Google Homepage. Pretty much just typing out the words that you can see on the site. I have also written styles to start things up with CSS. I just followed the instructions in w3schools.com on how I can display the stuff you can see at the top-right and bottom part of Google Homepage. I'm having problems with the float function at the moment. The order of the list gets reversed everytime I position the list (Gmail, Images, Google Apps and Sign In) at the right. It's shown as Sign In, Google Apps and so on. (I'm sorry if this is confusing. English isn't my first language. I'll rewrite this once I finish the project because I'm writing this in turbulence.) I also need to learn more about the common tags that developers use in HTML since I'm not really used to "nav" or "div". The usage is confusing. At what instance should I use them? What I'll do is pretty much read a lot? I'm literally learning a new language so I should widen my vocabulary. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my output tonight because I didn't really have any idea how to start this at the start.

Before:

I am feeling lazy coding any stuff, but I got the momentum when I got curious on how I can replicate the top-right navigation links in Google on my version of it.

After:

I was able to align the top-right navigation links to the right place, but I am confused on the CSS functions I typed. I have also modified the html file and incorporated 'nav' and 'div'. Watching Youtube helped me understand them, yet it feels like I'm still missing something out. What I'll do tomorrow is to strengthen my knowledge on the basic syntax on HTML and CSS. I'd probably check Udemy and review the curriculums they have as I don't really want to spend money learning how to code. After taking notes, my research about the syntax might take me a week. Thus, I'd be pausing this homework for now so that, hopefully, when I get back, I'll be able to understand the guides more. I'm avoiding copy-pasting codes at all cost. That's not best way to learn coding. I mean, I can do that, but I should first understand the code thoroughly before copying it, right?
